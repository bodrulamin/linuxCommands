To check whether the Ubuntu system supports virtualization, run the following command.

$ egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
To check if your system supports KVM virtualization execute the command:

$ sudo kvm-ok

If the “kvm-ok” utility is not present on your server, install it by running the apt command:

$ sudo apt install cpu-checker

Now execute the “kvm-ok” command to probe your system.

$ sudo kvm-ok


Step 2: Install KVM on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

With the confirmation that our system can support KVM virtualization, we are going to install KVM, To install KVM, virt-manager, bridge-utils and other dependencies, run the command:

$ sudo apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
A little explanation of the above packages.

    The qemu package (quick emulator) is an application that allows you to perform hardware virtualization.
    The qemu-kvm package is the main KVM package.
    The libvritd-daemon is the virtualization daemon.
    The bridge-utils package helps you create a bridge connection to allow other users to access a virtual machine other than the host system.
    The virt-manager is an application for managing virtual machines through a graphical user interface.

Before proceeding further, we need to confirm that the virtualization daemon – libvritd-daemon – is running. To do so, execute the command.

$ sudo systemctl status libvirtd
You can enable it to start on boot by running:

$ sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

To check if the KVM modules are loaded, run the command:

$ lsmod | grep -i kvm
