Blacklisting it did the trick. I'm now running AMDGPU, at least until pro becomes available. I'll list the steps as the answer in case anyone else comes looking for answers.

Blacklisting built in kernel modules is done at startup, so grub does the work. Edit

/ect/default/grub

with the editor of your choice and add

modprobe.blacklist=radeon

in to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT right next to anything that might already be there, such as quiet splash. Then, save the changes and update grub.

sudo update-grub2

Reboot and you should be using AMDGPU instead of radeon. I should stress making sure your card is compatible, else blacklisting your gfx module is likely to cause problems.
