If you launch kde from xinit command , you could set the following environment variables in ~/.xinitrc ,

export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus

This will make all programs respect ibus. (If this don't work for you , modify startkde4 script directly , add the 3 lines to the top of it , after #!/bin/sh

And also a auto-start of ibus program , ibus-daemon -xd , set this in systemsettings , there's something named "Startup" , can't remember the exact name

ibus-daemon --xim -drx --desktop=kde
